# Graphics-II.Final
This was the final project in P&amp;P 4 (Graphics-II). We were given a word document with task and had to complete it in 24 hours. This was after our month long course project and was 30% of our grade. I had to build the .obj Loader or use a program that was given out to convert it to a header file *(Though then the models would have a floating HFILE to let the professor know we didn't build a loader)*, so I chose to **build the .obj loader**. only thing I couldn't get in was the shooting mechanic of the game as I ran out of time.
